Genus 0 Congruence Subgroups.m == For a genus 0 congruence subgroup Gamma (up to conjugation in PGL_2(Z)) we compute its hauptmodul h, and 
                                  a rational function pi_(t) in K_N(t) such that pi(h)=j. Here N is the level of Gamma, K_N is the N-th cyclotomic field
                                  and j is the modular j-invariant function.
